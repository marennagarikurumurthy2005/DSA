# You have a set of integers s, which originally contains all the numbers from 1 to n. Unfortunately, due to some error, one of the numbers in s got duplicated to another number in the set, which results in repetition of one number and loss of another number.

# You are given an integer array nums representing the data status of this set after the error.

# Find the number that occurs twice and the number that is missing and return them in the form of an array.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [1,2,2,4]
# Output: [2,3]
# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [1,1]
# Output: [1,2]
 

# Constraints:

# 2 <= nums.length <= 104
# 1 <= nums[i] <= 104


nums = [1,1]
duplicate=0
missing=0
s=set()
for i in nums:
    if i not  in s:
        s.add(i)
               
    else:
            duplicate=i     
for i in range(1,len(nums)+1):
    if i not in s:
        missing=i
print([duplicate,missing])


# s=set()
# for i in range(len(nums)-1):
#     if nums[i]==nums[(i+1)]:
#         s.add(i+1)
#         s.add(i+2)
# print(s)
